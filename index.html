        <h3>What is openGH</h3>

<p>It’s an open initiative created to be a meeting point for all code enthusiasts inside Grasshopper3d community. If you have been searching for a place where research, share and learn about coding related to Grasshopper with other people around the world, this is it.</p>

<h3>How could I contribute?</h3>

<p>The first thing you need to start a project is a personal GitHub account. Then, just send and email to openghdev@gmail.com with your project proposal and we will open a new repository (with a small description and README and LICENSE files) giving you full administration permissions. 

After that you are responsible for managing the repository, granting access and permissions for every new participant.

The OpenGH team will be there to help you as far as we can in any trouble you have with the repository administration. Our idea is to make a self-managed community, the coding translation of the official Grasshopper3d forum.</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
